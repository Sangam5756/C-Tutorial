/*
  ****************Procedure oriented Programmin***********
1.Consists of writting a set of instruction of the computer to follow
2.main focus on function and not on flow of data 
3.function uses global or local variable
4.data moves freely from function to function

***************Object oriented programming*******************
1.Works on the concept of object and class
2.A class is a template to create the object
3.Treat data as critical elements
4.Decomposses   the problem  in object and builds data and function
around the object 

Global Variable:
                The variable which declare outside  the main function
                is called global variable
                the global variable is called anywhere inside the main function
Local variable:
              The variable which declare inside the main function
              the local variable only called inside the  main function


************Basic concepts of object oriented programming************

    CLASS-> Basic template to create the object

    OBJECTS->Basic run time entries

    Date abstraction and encapsulation-->wraping data and function into
                                       into single unit

    Abstraction --> user dont know the code they only see the output
    Inheritance--> Properties of one class can be inherited into others

    Polymorphism --> Ability to take more than one forms

    Dynamic Binding-->Which code is execute is not known until the program run.
                    
    Message passing --> Object.message(information) call format

*******************Benefits of Object oriented programming************
1.Better code reusability  using objects and class
2.Principle of data hiding to help  build secure system
3.Multiple object can co-exit without any interference
4.Software complexity can be easily managed
